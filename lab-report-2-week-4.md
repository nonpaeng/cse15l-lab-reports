## Relationship Between bug, symptom, and failure-inducing input
---
In terms of discussing the relationship between bug, symptom and failure-inducing input, it is important to take an iterative and patient to approaching the issue. When the symptom first arises, it is usually in the form of a terminal error, where either an error/exception or wrong output is present. In the case this happens, you will examine the input (the different file tests in our case), and analyze how the bug in the code itself can be resolved, whether it is adding more code to resolve the symptom, fixing the bug with adjustments to it, or deleting the bug all together. In testing and debugging, it is important to not do too many things at once, since this can negatively affect your code and make what was once working, not work and this can lead to more confusion.
